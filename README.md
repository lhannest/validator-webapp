## validator-webapp

The webapp/client directory was generated by Swagger using the `beacon-aggregator-spec.yaml` specification file. ApiClient was modified slightly to expose the requesting URL. This will have to be added again if the client code is ever regenerated unless you use the `--skip-overwrite` flag with Swagger.

Run the application with Docker. On Linux:

```shell
cd validator-webapp
docker build -t validator .
docker run --rm -p 5000:5000 validator
```

The `--rm` flag for `docker run` ensures that the container will be deleted after closing, so that containers don't add up every time you run the image. The `-p` flag bridges ports from within the container to the host network. The application will run on port 5000 within the container, and we map it to the host's port 5000.

With the application running, open your browser to http://localhost:5000 to see it in action.
